Adds a **heatmap graph** to Anki's main window which visualizes past and future card review activity, similar to the contribution view on GitHub. Information on the **current streak** is displayed alongside the heatmap. Clicking on an item shows the cards reviewed or due on that day.

**COMPATIBILITY**

Initial tests have shown this add-on to both work on Anki 2.0.x and Anki 2.1.x. However, as the Anki 2.1.x line of releases is still in beta, I cannot provide any kind of official support for this platform. **Please do not report issues with Anki 2.1 in the review section below**. Instead, please report all issues you encounter on [GitHub](https://github.com/glutanimate/review-heatmap/issues). As I'm not using Anki 2.1.x myself it might take me a while to address them.
